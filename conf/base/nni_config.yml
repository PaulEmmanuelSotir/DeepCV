# NNI expriment configuration (see https://nni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial/ExperimentConfig.html)
# This file is used by DeepCV as an experiment configuration template for all hyperparameter searches using [Neural Network Intelligence](https://nni.readthedocs.io)
# NOTE: These configurations are common to all hyperparameter searches, if you need to configure an hyperparameter search for a specific model, you should modify appropriate hp search configuration in parameters.yml

experimentName: "" # Will be populated automatically by DeepCV (named after mlflow experiment name)
searchSpacePath: "" # Will be determined by model name to be "./conf/base/hp_search_spaces/<model_name>_search_space.json" or will be overriden by your hp search configuration in parameters.yml ('searchSpacePath' entry if any)

maxTrialNum: -1 # Can be overriden by trials number ('maxTrialNum') you configured for your hyperparameter search in parameters.yml
# maxExecDuration: 2h # Feel free to uncomment this if you want a default maximal execution duration for all of your hyperparameter searches. Can be overriden by your hyperparameter search config in parameters.yml
