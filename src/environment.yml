        - kedro==0.16.3 # Deepcv project structure and pipelining comes from Kedro template and framework. Kedro is an open source development workflow framework that implements software engineering best-practice for data pipelines with an eye towards productionising machine learning models.
        - hilbertcurve=1.0.* # Used for an alternative approach to CoordConv where we append a single feature map of Hilbert Curve coordinates instead of euclidian coordinates on two features maps (see 'deepcv.meta.nn.concat_hilbert_coords_channel' function)
        - tensorboard # Tensorboard package now installs official tensorboard (may have tensorflow as dependency), allows Web UI vizualization of a run (vizualize metrics, parameters, ... logged to tensorboard during or after training)
        - tensorboardX # Tensorboard logging for pytorch
        - networkx=2.* # Graph library for creation, manipulation, study of the structure, dynamics, and function of complex networks/graphs.
